    <div class="container-fluid" style="padding: 55px 20px 0 20px;">
        Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a
        perfect blend of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by
        various civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form.
        <br><br>
        India has a rich culinary heritage. Indian cuisine has a 5000-year-old history. Mythological beliefs and
        traditions have played an important role in its evolution and development. The main Indian food was based on
        Hinduism but the Islamic influence during the Mughal era, the Persian exchanges with the Middle East and the
        British colonial system have all contributed immensely towards laying the foundation of the Indian cuisine.
        <br><br>
        India is a big country with many states and regions. Each region offers a unique assortment of dishes and
        cooking techniques. Each regional cuisine uses its own locally grown herbs, spices, fruits and vegetables. These
        regional cuisines collectively combined together form the very delightful Indian Cuisine.
        <br><br>
        The staple Indian foods are Rice, Wheat and Lentils. And no Indian dish is complete without spices. Indian food
        is a combination of all six tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter, spicy and astringent. In India different
        dishes are prepared for different festivals. Every festival tends to be complete only when special food
        associated with that festival is cooked on that day. Like Holi can not be complete without Gujhiya and Eid
        without Sewai.
        <br><br>
        India is the only country in the world where there is Unity in Diversity not only its culture & religion but
        also its cuisine.
        <br><br>
        Foods of India are better known for its spiciness. Throughout India, be it North India or South India, spices
        are used generously in food. But one must not forget that every single spice used in Indian dishes carries some
        or the other nutritional as well as medicinal properties.

    <div id="north_india" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 55px;">
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <h3>North Indian Cuisine</h3>
            North Indian States include: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar
            Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.
            <br><br>
            North Indian cuisine contains a rich variety of breads like naan, chapatis and rotis which are made
            primarily by using wheat as the chief ingredient. This leads us to the belief that North Indian food is
            lighter as compared to South Indian cuisine. North Indian Cuisine is strongly influenced by the Mughal way
            of cooking. These are techniques you will find in Kashmir, Hyderabad, and Central Asia. These are dishes
            that were enjoyed by Nawabs several decades ago. These include rajma dal, lacha paratha, dal bati dum aloo,
            palak paneer, and many more.
        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 55px;">
            <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">North Indian Ingredients</h5>
            North Indian food more commonly uses meat and dairy as the centerpiece of their dishes rather than seafood
            and vegetables of the South. The most frequently used meats are mutton and lamb, goat, and chicken. Beef
            isn’t as common in India as some Hindus regard cows as sacred animals. Don’t be fooled; vegetables still
            have their place in Northern cuisine; just different ones take prominence. Spinach, mustard greens,
            radishes, and cauliflower are among some of the vegetables that can be found in everyday dishes.
            <br><br>
            Rather than using coconut milk, North Indian dishes are more often made using dairy cream and blended nuts.
            The North’s winter can be pretty frigid, so nuts and thick creams are the perfect way to add comfort and
            warmth to any dish.
            <br><br>
            Along with coconut milk being subbed out, South India’s spicier spices are replaced with North India’s more
            milder ones like amchoor (dried mango powder) and dried fenugreek.
            <br><br>
            Once the meats, vegetables, spices, and sauces are selected, North Indians will often enjoy their meal with
            a side of flatbread. Wheat grows in abundance in the Northern states, creating a more wheat-based than a
            rice-based diet. Enjoy fresh naan, roti, chapati, and several bread variations, all derived from the wheat
            grown right on the land.
            <br><br>
            The different crops and ingredients from each region allow the North and South to have their own specialty
            dishes and appetizers.

                        <b>Naan</b> is a traditional flatbread that resembles pita. Naan is made of wheat flour and
                        butter combined and leavened but can also be Tandoor-grilled or Tawa-fried. Naan can be served
                        beside curries and stews or slathered with various chutneys.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Samosas</b> are fried or baked pastries that are filled with savory ingredients. Samosas
                        aren’t exclusive to North India and can be found in the local cuisines of South Asia, the Middle
                        East, Central Asia, East Africa, and other regions. Samosas can be filled with meat or
                        vegetarian options, and many include chutneys for extra moisture and flavor.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Seekh Kebabs</b> are delicious kebabs that can be made of various ground meats but are more

                        ginger, cilantro, and other spices and mixed until thoroughly combined. Then, the meat is rolled
                        into a sausage-like shape and grilled to be served with raw red onion and mint-cilantro chutney.

        <h3>South Indian Cuisine</h3>
        <div>
            It is mostly believed that South Indian cuisine consists largely of vegetarian food but it is not entirely
            true. Even though idlis and dosas dominate the South Indian food scenario, the cuisine also has abundant
            non-vegetarian options despite being dominated by vegetarian food items. The main thing about South Indian
            cuisine is that most things that it contains are made of rice. Apart from rice, key ingredients used in
            South Indian Cuisine would be ginger, garlic, plantains, tamarind, native fruits coconut, and fresh green
            chilies. These ingredients are famous for their flavor, and amazing health benefits.
            <br><br>
            If you look for non-vegetarian options in South Indian cuisine, you will find ample seafood. The Malabar
            coast is famous for its variety of fish.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 55px;">
        <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">South Indian Ingredients</h5>
        In South India, heavy rainfall and the Indian ocean allow beautiful fruits and vegetables to grow in abundance.
        <br><br>
        The coast offers delicious seafood, including sardines, Indian salmon, prawns, and tuna. With tons of fruits,
        vegetables, and seafood to choose from, you’ll notice South Indian cuisines are more often vegetarian or
        pescatarian-based. You can still find many meat dishes, but if you’re dining on the coast, we recommend you
        indulge in the rich seafood that surrounds you.
        <br><br>
        As a cooking agent, tropical coconut milk is frequently used for making curries. When it comes to spices the
        South is known for hotter spice mixes made with Huli Pudi (sambar powder), tamarind, cinnamon, mustard seed,
        cardamom, nutmeg, clover, and dried curry leaves. Although the climate is already hot enough, South Indians use
        spices with more heat because it helps induce sweat and help the body cool down.
        <br><br>
        All of the delicious seafood, fruits, vegetables, and spices of the South are typically served over rice Rice is
        a significant component of the South Indian diet. Because seafood and fruit are so low in calories, rice is a
        good energy source in the draining South Indian heat. <br><br>
        The foods and flavors produced by the South Indian climate define traditional South Indian cuisine. If you’re
        not sure what exactly to order when traveling in the South, lean towards dishes that showcase fruits,
        vegetables, and various fish; you’ll surely be pleased.

                    <b>Biryani</b> is an aromatic mixed rice dish that’s made in several ways but often includes spices,
                    meat, eggs, yogurt, and vegetables. Biryani is also found in North India, but there are variations
                    specific to the South in cities like Hyderabad.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Coconut Chutney</b> is another option for taming heat. Chutney is a condiment you can make with
                    pretty much any fruit or vegetable, but the South’s tropics grow large and flavorful coconuts that
                    make for a great chutney. Serve this chutney as an accompaniment to dosas, idlis, or a variety of
                    South Indian dishes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Idli</b> is one of the most popular breakfast sides enjoyed in the South. Idli are savory and
                    light steamed cakes made with a fermented rice and lentil batter. The cakes are fluffy yet filling
                    and can be served with any sambar or chutney you’d like.
